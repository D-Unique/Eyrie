Monolithic Backend with Express.js
Project Overview
This project is a monolithic backend built using Express.js, designed to handle various business logic and provide APIs for the application. It serves as the core of the backend architecture and integrates with multiple features, including database operations, authentication, and real-time functionality.

Key Features & Functionalities:
RESTful API: Implements a set of RESTful endpoints for handling requests.

Database Integration: Uses a relational or NoSQL database for persistent data storage.

Authentication: Secure user authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Middleware: Custom middleware for request handling, validation, and logging.

Error Handling: Centralized error handling for all routes.

Logging: Built-in logging with winston or morgan for request tracking and error monitoring.

Setup & Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:

Node.js (version >= 14.x.x)

npm (Node Package Manager)

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd project-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add the required environment variables:

ini
Copy
PORT=3000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
Running the Project
To start the Express.js application, run the following command:

bash
Copy
npm start
This will start the server on http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you've configured in .env).

You can also run the project in development mode for auto-reloading during changes using:

bash
Copy
npm run dev
API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /auth/register: Register a new user.

POST /auth/login: Log in with email and password.

Users
GET /users: Retrieve all users.

GET /users/:id: Retrieve a user by ID.

PUT /users/:id: Update user information.

DELETE /users/:id: Delete a user by ID.

Example Request (GET /users)
bash
Copy
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/users
Middleware
Request Logger
The logger.js middleware is responsible for logging incoming requests and their details for tracking.

Error Handling
All errors encountered in the application are captured and passed through the centralized error handler.

Database Integration
The backend uses MongoDB (or a relational database of your choice) for storing data.

Example Database Connection (with Mongoose for MongoDB)
js
Copy
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect(process.env.DB_URI, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
  .then(() => console.log("Database connected"))
  .catch((err) => console.log("Database connection error: ", err));
