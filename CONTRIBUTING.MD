## Development Workflow

1. **Sync with upstream** before starting new work:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

**Create a feature branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
3. **Make your changes** following our code style guidelines
4. **Run tests** to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality
5. **Commit your changes** using the commit guidelines below
6. **Push to your fork:**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
7. **Create a Pull Request** from your branch to the main repository

## Branching Strategy
We follow **Git Flow** to maintain an organized workflow:

- **`main`**: The production-ready branch. Only tested and approved code is merged here.
- **`dev`**: The integration branch for ongoing development. All feature branches should be branched from and merged back into this branch.
- **Feature branches (`feat/<feature-name>`)**: Used for new features or enhancements. Always branch from `dev`.
- **Bugfix branches (`bugfix/<issue-name>`)**: Used for fixing bugs in `dev`.
- **Hotfix branches (`hotfix/<issue-name>`)**: Used for critical fixes on `main`. These are merged into both `main` and `dev`.
- **Release branches (`release/<version>`)**: Used to prepare for a new release. This is branched off `dev` and merged into `main` when stable.

## Commit Guidelines
We follow the Conventional Commits specification:
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```
Types include:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fixes bug nor adds features
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks


Examples:
```
feat(auth): add JWT authentication

Implements user authentication using JWT tokens.

References: Issue #12
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a Pull Request** from your feature branch to the appropriate branch in the main repository

2. **Fill out the PR template** with:

- Description of changes
- Related issue(s)
- Type of change
- Checklist of completed items


3. **Request reviews** from team members
4. **Address feedback** and make necessary changes
5. **The PR will be merged** once it receives approval and passes all CI checks


## Weekly Team Rotations
As mentioned in the project overview, teams will rotate weekly to encourage cross-functional collaboration and learning. Please be prepared to:

1. **Document your work thoroughly** before rotation
2, **Participate in knowledge transfer sessions** with the incoming team
3. **Be available for questions** from team members taking over your previous responsibilities
